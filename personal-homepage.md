#Personal Homepage Project
The goal of this project is create your own personal homepage. This can be anything you envision.

Try to limit yourself to only frontend. You can add backend features in the future. This class is focused on frontend. Ideally this would be a playground or platform where you can practice the material from class.

You will have time to work this project in class. You can also work on it outside of class.

#What is your personal homepage?
This is a platform to be your presence on the internet.

-Information about you
-Experimental lab
    -show your CSS and JS experiments
-Links and descriptions for your projects
-Blog
-CS code samples and experiments
-Anything else you can think of...

This can any project you want it to be. Keeping some limits will allow you to get more out of the project.

Again, the class is focused on frontend, so imit yourself to only frontend features. And keep in mind that you can expand the project in the future.
